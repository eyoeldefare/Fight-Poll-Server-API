# Fight-Poll-Server-API

This is the Server side API end point for the flutter application Fight Poll. This server side API is capable of authenticating users using JWT token, allowing users to post a poll on their story, allowing them to vote on poll, update their vote, and view their vote. The application uses Postgres database for data serving. Overall the application is a social networking application that allows a user to share his/her poll with other people online allowing these people to vote on the poll, comment on the poll, and also create their own poll.

The application uses Flutter Doctor on the client side which is posted on my git hub page under Fight-Poll repository.
